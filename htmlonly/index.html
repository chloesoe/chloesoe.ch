        <h1>HTMLonly</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Website nowadays tend to be overloaded with a lots of data which is not useful and distracting the user.</p>
        <p>Nowadays a normal Website not only consists of the HTML code but 
        also loads several Javascript files, Stylesheet files, Flash elements 
        etc. Websites use several KB whereby the information itself consists of 
        only some Bytes. This seems maybe not as a problem as the bandwidth is 
        increasing every year but not in all countries high speed internet is 
        accessible yet. Furthermore, also bandwidth is a resource and also this 
        resource should be used carefully.</p>
        <p>Even small websites with only small amount of information tend to 
        have a lot of design elements to fill out the emptiness of the website, 
        instead of designing the content and improving the information.</p>
        <p>A Further trend is the use of asynchronous communication and 
        loading data on the fly on the website. As this may be a good idea for 
        some attributes of the websites, an overuse of this technique makes the 
        experience just annoying.</p>
        <p>I think it is time to stop this nonsense and raise the awareness of
        this problem. Let's make the web about information again. Let's build 
        clean, pure, only HTML sites.</p>
